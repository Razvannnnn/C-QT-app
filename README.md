# CPP-QT-app

In the second semester at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at UBB Cluj-Napoca, I developed an application using C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented in Qt. The application is built around basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to manage a list of food items. These items can be displayed in either a list or table format. Additionally, users can add selected food items to a wishlist, which can be exported as a CSV, HTML, or TXT file for further use. This project provided valuable experience in GUI development and file handling.
